Our project was used from an open source Java project found on Github. The original source code created a battleship game in the command prompt, and our new, updated version of it creates a gui interface for the game. 

To do this, we added a new class called GUI to the project files. This creates the pop-up window that contains a 10x10 grid for the game. Each grid slot is a button that can be pressed. This then sends the information to the Game class which calculates the moves from there.

For every button pressed, the program asks if it is a hit or miss. The result will either produce a picture of open sea (miss) or a ship getting hit (hit).

The Version Control that we are using is GitHub.

CASE Tools: Eclipse along with Window Builder
